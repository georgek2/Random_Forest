# Random_Forest

    RandomForestRegressor algorithm in Scikit-Learn

 > Model_One: Label Encoding columns with low cardinality
 
  + Label Encoder
  + Eliminating columns with missing values..
  
 
 > Model_Two: One Hot Encoding
 
  + OneHotEncoder in action. Dropping columns with missing entries..
  + Encoding only the categorical cols with low cardinality
  
  
  > Model Three: Pipelines
  
  + Using the concept of pipelines to help with the encoding.
  + Using the preprocessor with the numerical and categorical transformers simpifies the code.
  + The pipeline bundles preprocessing and modelling steps.
  + Fit the pipeline and make predictions.
